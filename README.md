Data visualisation exercising

## Motivation
This summer, I worked with some datasets from Kaggle to hone my visualization skills and grip a better understanding of the data. Moreover, while creating the following report, I have been mastering usage of markdown rules.
## Datasets
The datasets chosen for these exercises consisted different combinations of numeric and categorical features, for such exemplary data will provide me with a chance for practising visualization of different dependencies. Moreover, news set consisted of articles and their titles. This led me to visualization methods working on the word sets. To other crucial features belonged the coordinate systems in UFO dataset or multiple categorical values in the HR set.
The datasets are as follow:  
[News](https://www.kaggle.com/clmentbisaillon/fake-and-real-news-dataset?select=True.csv "Fake or True News")  
[UFO](https://www.kaggle.com/NUFORC/ufo-sightings?select=scrubbed.csv "UFO sightings")  
[HR](https://www.kaggle.com/rhuebner/human-resources-data-set "Human Resources")  
[COVID-19](https://www.kaggle.com/imdevskp/corona-virus-report?select=worldometer_data.csv "COVID-19 daily report")
